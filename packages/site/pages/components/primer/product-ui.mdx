Primer React Components can be used in Markdown files by importing them from `@primer/react`.

[Refer to the Primer React documentation](https://primer.style/react) for more information on which components are available and how to use them.

## Importing and using Primer components

1. Import a component from `@primer/react`:

```js
import {Button} from '@primer/react'
```

2. Use the component in your Markdown file, but ensure that you wrap the component in a `div` with the `custom-component` class. This will ensure that article formatting isn't applied to the custom component.

```jsx
<div className="custom-component">
  <Button variant="primary">Danger</Button>
</div>
```
