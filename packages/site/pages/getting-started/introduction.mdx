This guide will walk you through creating, customizing, and deploying a new documentation site powered by Doctocat on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## 1. Create a new Next.js installation

Start by creating a new Next.js project using the [Next.js CLI](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation):

## 2. Install Doctocat (Next.js)

Next, install Doctocat and its dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save @primer/doctocat-nextjs
```

## 3. Update your Next.js configuration

Update your next.config.js file to use the Doctocat theme:

```js
// next.config.js
const withDoctocat = require('@primer/doctocat-nextjs')

module.exports = withDoctocat({
  // your next.js config
})
```

### Optional: GitHub Pages configuration

If you plan to deploy your site to GitHub Pages, you'll need to add the following to your `next.config.js` file:

```js
output: 'export'
```

## 4. Add the Doctocat stylesheets

Add the required Doctocat stylesheets to your `pages/_app.(tsx|jsx)` file:

```js
import { AppProps } from "next/app";
import "@primer/doctocat-nextjs/css/global.css";

function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default App;
```

## 5. Add your content

Next, go ahead and put your Markdown documents (`.md` or `.mdx`) in `pages/`. Documents in `pages/` automatically become pages with URLs based on their path relative to `pages/`. For example, if you create a `pages/components/box.md` file, Doctocat will use that file to create a `/components/box` page.

Important:

- You must use `.md` or `.mdx` extensions for your documents.
- Folders must contain an index.md or index.mdx file for breadcrumbs to work correctly. The contents of this file can be left empty

## 6. Update Frontmatter on all pages

Side navigation for your site is generated automatically from the frontmatter of your pages. To add a page to the side navigation, you must add a `title` and `description` to the frontmatter of your page. For example:

```md
---
title: My page title
description: My page description
---
```

## 7. Deploy to GitHub Pages

After you've customized the content of your site, you're ready to deploy. There are many ways to deploy your site, but we currently use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for most of our sites, and have found it to be an easy way to get sites up and running quickly.

Congrats! You've shipped your first Doctocat site on Next.js ðŸŽ‰
