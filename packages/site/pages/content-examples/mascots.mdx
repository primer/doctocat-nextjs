title: Mascots
description: Mona the Octocat and supporting robot mascots are beloved icons of the open source community, and an intregal part of GitHub's brand. We take protecting her and her robot sidekicks seriously, and have developed the following guidelines to help keep her from going the way of Clippy™. Before slapping a mascot on a piece of content, please consider the following guidelines.

## The Octocat

![Mona's head in front and profile](https://github.com/primer/brand/assets/19292210/8865f073-1a37-4130-8b4b-1824f732de98)

Part cat, part octopus, Mona is a pioneer of the Octocat species and is our official mascot. To the average person, Mona is just a cartoon character. But to the developer community, Mona is an icon.

In general, Mona starts to appear the closer that we get to speaking about the open source community.

## Copilot

The newest addition to the Octocat Universe, Copilot represents the latest in AI tech.

In general, Copilot starts to appear the closer we get to talking about the GitHub Copilot product specifically, and AI in general.

## Hubot

Based on our open source [chat bot](https://hubotio.github.io/hubot/), Hubot is Mona’s robot sidekick and most loyal contributor. He can be programmed to perform any task but is not made with the latest AI and might become a bit snarky if his instructions are not explicit. While Copilot may be the brains, Hubot is the muscle.

In general, Hubot shows up when the surrounding content is regarding automation and productivity.

## Usage Guidelines

> When it comes to using mascots in brand applications, less is more.

Our mascots shouldn't just be space-fillers. Overuse can be distracting and annoying, and underuse can create missed opportunities for surprise and delight. Balance and thoughtful intent are imperative. Preserve the magic of our beloved characters by using them sparingly, and only when the context is appropriate. The following do's and dont's provide some general guidance on what is or is not appropriate context, however all public-facing usage of Mascots must be approved by GitHub’s Brand & Marketing Design team.

## Alternate Octocat Styles

While working with our current brand design system, octocats should be added in the style seen at the top of this page. However, there are a handful of alternate styles that we use for specific use cases.
